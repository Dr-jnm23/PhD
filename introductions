Acknowledgements

Firstly I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Paul Raithby and Prof. Brian Johnson for their boundless support, tolerance and encouragement.

Further thanks must go to the other members of the Raithby, Johnson, Mays and Wright groups. In particular Chris Adams for guiding me through practical work and tolerating me breaking his glassware. Anthony Woods for general amusement value, advice and cunning ideas. Also Pieman, Clare, Jody, Richard, Hopcakes and Sara for providing laughs in the lab. Thanks to Andy Hearley and Scott McIndoe for advice on mass spec.

I am also indebted to Zack, Steve and Pat for general help around the lab, in particular supplies of nitrogen for my reactions whilst in the maverick Part 1A lab. The NMR, MS, XRD and microanalyses services also did a sterling job in characterising my compounds.

Outside the lab I would like to thank the Emma people for many amusing nights out. Their ability to consume vast quantities of lager and patronise local nightclubs was legendary. Special mention should go to Sean, Steve, Tweed, JB and Christian for solid attendance records at Cindyâ€™s. Marshall, Jones, Martha and Itchy kept the MCR strong in the face of adversity.

A special mention should go to my chemistry teacher (1990-1994), Trevor Read. His knowledge and enthusiasm were an inspiration and his demonstrations always entertaining.

Finally I would like to thank my family for moral and financial support throughout University life.
